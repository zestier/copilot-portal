# Playwright e2e tests

End-to-end tests for the portal, run against the production build with an
isolated SQLite database and a **stubbed** Copilot client (`COPILOT_STUB=1`)
so no real GitHub Copilot credentials or network are required.

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium   # one-time
pnpm test:e2e
```

The `webServer` in `playwright.config.ts` builds the app and launches
`node build` on port 4173 against `e2e/.tmp-data/` (wiped on each run).

## Stub mode

When the server starts with `COPILOT_STUB=1`, `bridge.ts` swaps the real
`CopilotClient` for an in-process fake that responds to `send({prompt})`
with a streamed `"Stubbed reply to: <prompt>"`. The full turn-runner,
SSE, and persistence paths are exercised normally.
