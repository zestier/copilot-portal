# The SvelteKit build output is pure JS (arch-independent). The only native
# artifact is `better-sqlite3`'s `.node`. To avoid running `vite build` under
# QEMU when cross-compiling, the `build` stage runs natively on the host
# platform; the `deps` stage runs on the target platform and uses pnpm's
# install lifecycle to fetch the right prebuilt `.node` from npm. The
# `runtime` stage combines them.
